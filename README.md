# BeerBot
BeerBot is a python based discord bot that deploys and collects information on a Beer related survey. It then uses that data to train an AI using the tensorflow library. This feedback is a suggested beer style based on the National Brewer's Society's List of beer styles. This started as a google colab project and I am currently working on moving it over to this git repository.

BeerBot is 100% python code using several libraries; discord, tensorflow, pandas, csv, logging, numpy, and more. The idea was to learn discord.py and tensorflow then apply them together. Discord was chosen to both avoid any UI development and to provide a platform to gather data at a large scale. For anyone looking to understand this code I would suggest you spend time learning about the discord API, discord.py, and the tensorflow library for machine learning. Personally, I would suggest checking out freecodecamp.org They are an amazing group who have tons of quality information about coding. I have included a couple examples of code that I created from their tutorials. freecodecamp.org and their youtube page are amazing resources and I wanted to take this oppurtunity to thank them here. If any of you guys are reading this, Thank you and please enjoy my program.
